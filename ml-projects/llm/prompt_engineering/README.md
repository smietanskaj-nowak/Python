# Prompt Engineering with Ollama

This project demonstrates **prompt engineering techniques for large language models**
using **Ollama** as a local inference framework.

The focus is on understanding how prompt structure, instructions, and constraints
affect model responses, rather than on model training or fine-tuning.

## 📌 Project Overview

- Topic: Prompt engineering and LLM interaction
- Framework: Ollama
- Models: Local large language models supported by Ollama
- Focus: Prompt design, instruction tuning, and response analysis

This project explores practical aspects of working with LLMs in an inference-only setup.

---

## 🧠 Scope

The notebooks cover:
- constructing effective prompts
- controlling model behavior through instructions
- analyzing variability and limitations of LLM outputs
- comparing responses under different prompt formulations

No model training or parameter updates are performed.
