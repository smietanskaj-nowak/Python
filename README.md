# Machine Learning & Data Science Projects

This repository contains Python-based projects in **machine learning, NLP, and large language models (LLMs)**,
focused on **practical modeling workflows, evaluation, and interpretability**.
The emphasis is on understanding model behavior, assumptions, and trade-offs,
rather than on isolated benchmarks or toy examples.

## Repository Structure

- **ml/** – classical machine learning and deep learning projects  
  - regression and classification (scikit-learn, XGBoost)  
  - neural networks and CNNs (TensorFlow, PyTorch)  
  - model interpretability (e.g. feature importance, LIME)  
  - large-scale data processing with PySpark  

- **llm/** – large language model–oriented projects  
  - fine-tuning and comparison of transformer-based models  
  - inference workflows and prompt engineering  
  - evaluation and benchmarking setups  
  - retrieval-augmented generation (RAG, in progress)  

- **hackathons/** – applied, real-world projects  
  - cheminformatics datasets (ChEMBL, ZINC)  
  - molecular descriptor engineering  
  - explainable classification models
