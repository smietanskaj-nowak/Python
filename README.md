# Machine Learning & Data Science Projects

This repository contains Python-based projects demonstrating **machine learning, data analysis, and visualization**. It is organized into two branches:

- **projects** → collection of general ML notebooks (modeling, decision trees, neural networks, Spark, feature importance).  
- **hackathon** → dedicated branch with hackathon work on cheminformatics datasets (ChEMBL, ZINC, receptor activity prediction).

## 📂 Repository Structure

### Branch: `projects`
Notebooks included:
1. **python_modelling.ipynb** – classical regression and classification models.  
2. **data_visualization_decision_tree.ipynb** – decision tree visualization and interpretability.  
3. **Neural_networks.ipynb** – feed-forward neural networks (TensorFlow/Keras).  
4. **Spark_project_air quality analysis.ipynb** – big data air quality analysis with PySpark.  
5. **xgboost.ipynb** – feature importance analysis with Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, H2O).

### Branch: `hackathon`
Hackathon notebooks and datasets:
- **hackathon.ipynb**, **hackathon_test.ipynb** – cheminformatics hackathon project.  
- **Datasets**:  
  - `Chembl_data_5HT2A.csv` (training compounds),  
  - `ZINC_data_5HT2A.csv` (external screening compounds),  
  - `outaml_class.csv` (predicted activities).  
- **Methods**: scikit-learn, XGBoost, feature engineering with molecular descriptors, cross-validation.  
- **Visuals**: Feature importance plots (`predictors.png`, `predictors_important.png`).  

**Goal**: Predict 5-HT2A receptor activity and evaluate molecular descriptors as predictive features.  
**Outcome**: High-performance classification models with explainable feature rankings.
